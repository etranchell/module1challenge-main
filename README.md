## Description

What was your motivation?
My motivation for Module 1 challenge was to better learn semantic flow for CSS and HTML.  Also to learn Refactoring and leave code better than I found it.
Why did you build this project? The reason this project was built was to help learn refactoring and semantic flow.(Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
What problem does it solve? I cleaned up HTML and CSS semantic flow.
What did you learn? I learned refactoring code.  The proper semantic flow for code and how to make HTML coincide with CSS. 
What makes your project stand out? Unique file name and how I refactored is specific to me. The project mets acceptance criteria.
